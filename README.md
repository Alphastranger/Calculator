# Calculator
# Functionality
- This program is a simple calculator function, able to take in simple equations and solve them. Right now this is the first iteration, but I might see about adding more buttons and making the equations able to be more complex.
# Process
- I began by creating the HTML for the program, which was simple enough save for the time it took to set up all of the buttons.
- Next was CSS, which was mostly a struggle getting the flexboxes to align nicely and make it look like a solid machine.
- The JavaScript wasn't particularly complex, as it was mostly just getting buttons to work and then setting it up so that the program runs the strings as number equations.
- Mostly it was a time consuming process of getting all of the event listeners to work.
- I finished off by adding a clear button and then some functionality that allows equations to be made out of completed solutions.
